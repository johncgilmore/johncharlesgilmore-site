  <h1>About John Charles Gilmore</h1>

  <p>I'm John Gilmore, a Fractional COO and startup builder with a bias toward clarity, acceleration, and radical operational honesty. 
  After fifteen years leading operations in high-growth startups, I specialize in building systems that scale with the founder—not around them. 
  My work spans finance, people, legal, product, and revenue ops—and I’m most useful when a company feels stuck and no one can say exactly why.</p>
  
  <p>I'm driven by five core principles: Protect your ability to see, embody error correction, prioritize systems over sentiment, depend on others to sharpen your thinking, and accept that slow is fast. 
  These values guide how I diagnose hidden bottlenecks and create execution systems that hold up under pressure.</p>
  
  <p>If you’re building something fast—and it’s already outgrowing your team, systems, or clarity—I’ll help you catch up to your own vision.</p>
